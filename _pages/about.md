# 😁 About Me
Hi, I'm Yuchen Shi—thanks for stopping by!

I am a rising junior at NYU Shanghai pursuing double majors in Chemistry and Data Science. I am honored to work as an undergraduate research assistant in computational chemistry with
<strong style="color: #4b6aa1;">
  <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/glover/" style="color: #4b6aa1; text-decoration: none;">Professor William J. Glover's group</a>
</strong>
and
<strong style="color: #4b6aa1;">
  <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/tuckerman_group/" style="color: #4b6aa1; text-decoration: none;">Professor Mark E. Tuckerman's group</a>
</strong>.

My current interests center on **developing molecular dynamics (MD) techniques for complex systems** and **bridging molecular science with cutting-edge data science approaches**. I am also excited to explore neighboring areas including electronic structure, drug discovery, and quantum computing.

I am actively seeking a PhD position in theoretical/computational chemistry, data science, or computer science for Fall 2027. Fingers crossed!

# 📝 Research

## Research Experience

- *2025.10 – Present* · **Tuckerman Research Group** · NYU Department of Chemistry · PI: Mark E. Tuckerman
- *2024.02 – Present* · **Glover Group** · NYU Shanghai Department of Chemistry · PI: William J. Glover


## Selected Projects
### 1. Non-adiabatic Dynamics of Photo-response in Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFP)

**Supervisor:** William J. Glover <br>
**Keywords:** Photochemistry · Ab-initio Multiple Spawning (AIMS) · QM/MM <br>

Fluorescent proteins, first isolated from *A. victoria*, have become essential research tools across the life sciences. Their chromophores can undergo complex photochemical processes that change optical properties. We use non-adiabatic molecular dynamics to capture and interpret the excited-state behavior of GFP chromophores and to explore mutations that modulate photo-response, guiding the design and understanding of fluorescent proteins.

#### 1.1 Tuning the Photo-oxidation of the GFP Chromophore

The anionic chromophore is central to the GFP photocycle and mediates multiple photochemical pathways. By applying non-adiabatic dynamics, we resolved controversies surrounding the photodamage mechanism in the gas phase and proposed two chemical modification strategies to tune the UV response.

#### 1.2 UV Response of Neutral and Anionic GFP Chromophores

Building on the gas-phase study, we incorporated the protein environment and explicit solvent to simulate GFP excited-state dynamics more accurately. Comparing neutral and anionic chromophores revealed a promising mutation strategy that reshapes the local electrostatic environment to control photodamage.

### 2. Investigating Photo-relaxation of Uracil via Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics

**Supervisor:** William J. Glover <br>
**Keywords:** Spectroscopy · Ab-initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) · Enhanced Sampling <br>

Nucleotides are fundamental to DNA and RNA, yet prolonged UV exposure can trigger irreversible photodamage. We combine multiple computational techniques to complement experiments and shed light on the ultrafast dynamics of nucleotides.

#### 2.1 Theoretical Vibrational IR Spectra from Time-Correlation Functions

Time-correlation functions and ab initio molecular dynamics in both gas and condensed phases reveal the vibrational IR spectra of uracil and its photo-relaxation intermediates, highlighting the role of solvation effects in the process.

#### 2.2 Umbrella Sampling Free-Energy Study with a Planarity Descriptor

To explain the multiple relaxation timescales observed in uracil intermediates, Siyu Li (University of Oxford) and I worked on a molecular planarity descriptor and will employ umbrella sampling to construct the free-energy profile of the transition process.

### 3. Nuclear Quantum Effects in Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells

**Supervisor:** Mark E. Tuckerman <br>
**Keywords:** Electrochemistry · Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD) · Machine Learning <br>

Anion exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells promise efficient and flexible energy storage and conversion, yet their electrolytes often suffer from limited hydrogen transportation. Deep eutectic solvents (DES) offer tunable hydrogen-bond networks and high stability. By pairing PIMD simulations with machine-learning potentials, we efficiently capture nuclear quantum effects (NQE) to screen candidate electrolytes.

### 4. Representation Learning with a Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network

**Supervisor:** Shengjie Wang <br>
**Keywords:** Machine Learning · Computer Vision · Feature Extraction <br>

Modern vision systems depend on high-quality learned features, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a powerful way to extract hierarchical image structures. In this project, I developed a lightweight CNN-based autoencoder to learn representations from a fusion image dataset, evaluating performance using reconstruction loss and recognition accuracy. Techniques such as batch normalization, residual connections, self-attention, and data augmentation are included to enhanced the performance.

This work was for the final competition of CSCI-SHU 360 Machine Learning. It received a full score and ranked in the top 15%. Code is available on
