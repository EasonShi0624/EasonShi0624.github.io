# 😁 About Me
Hi, I'm Yuchen Shi. Welcome to my homepage!

I'm now a rising junior in NYUSH, pursing double majors in Chemistry and Data Science. I'm honored to work as an undergraduate research assistant studying computational chemistry in
<strong style="color: #4b6aa1;">
  <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/glover/" style="color: #4b6aa1; text-decoration: none;">Professor William J. Glover's group</a>
</strong>
and
<strong style="color: #4b6aa1;">
  <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/tuckerman_group/" style="color: #4b6aa1; text-decoration: none;">Professor Mark E. Tuckerman's group</a>
</strong>.


I'm interested in **studying how to apply and devlop Molecular Dynamics (MD) in complex systems** and **bridging molecular science with cutting-edged Data Science techniques**.

I'm actively seeking for a PhD position in Theoretical/Computaional Chemistry, Data Science, or Computer Science in 27 Fall. Finger crossed!
