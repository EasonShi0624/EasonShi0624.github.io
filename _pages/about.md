# 😁 About Me
Hi, I'm Yuchen Shi. Welcome to my homepage!

I'm now a rising junior in NYUSH, pursing double majors in Chemistry and Data Science. I'm honored to work as an undergraduate research assistant studying computational chemistry in
<strong style="color: #4b6aa1;">
  <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/glover/" style="color: #4b6aa1; text-decoration: none;">Professor William J. Glover's group</a>
</strong>
and

  <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/tuckerman_group/" style="color: #4b6aa1; text-decoration: none;">Professor Mark E. Tuckerman's group</a>
</strong>.


So far, I'm interested in **studying how to apply and devlop Molecular Dynamics (MD) in complex systems** and **bridging molecular science with cutting-edged Data Science techniques**.

I'm actively seeking for a PhD position in Theoretical/Computaional Chemistry, Data Science, or Computer Science in 27 Fall. Finger crossed!


# 📝 Research
## Research Experience

## Selected Projects
### 1. Non-adiabatic Dynamics of Photo-response in Green Fluoresent Proteins (GFP)
**Supervisor: William J. Glover**
**Keyword: Photochemistry; Ab-initio Multiple Spawning (AIMS); QM/MM**
Since firstly extracted in A. victoria, fluorescent proteins (FP) have evolved to be one of most essential research tools for multiple life science areas with their fantastic light-induced fluorescence. However, in application, the chromophore of fluorescent proteins could experience complex photochemical processes with the optical properties changed. We hope to use non-adiabatic molecular dynamics to capture its excited dynamics and tune its photo-reponse through mutations, hopefully guiding experiments explorations of protein engineering.

#### 1.2 UV Response of Neutral and Anionic Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Chromophore: A QM/MM Non-adiabatic Dynamics Study



### 2. Investigate Photo-relaxation of Uracil through Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics
**Supervisor: William J. Glover**
**Keyword: Spectroscopy; Ab-initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD); Enhanced Sampling**

#### 2.1 Theoretical Vibrational IR Spectra from Time-correlation Function (TCF)


#### 2.2 Umbrella Sampling-based Free Energy Study of Uracil with Planarity Descriptor


### 3. Nuclear Quantum Effects in Electrolytes based on Deep Eutectic Solvents
**Supervisor: Mark E. Tuckerman**
**Keyword: Electrochemistry; Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD); Machine Learning**


### 4. Representation Learning of Images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
**Supervisor: Shengjie Wang**
**Keyword: Machine Learning; Computer Vision; Feature Extraction**


This project was for the final competition of CSCI-SHU 360 Machine Learning and achieved a full score eventually. Codes are available on
